## Clean Data

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
```
```{r}
catch_original <- read_csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1", method = "libcurl"))
head(catch_original)
```
## Drop All and notes since we don't need them

```{r}
catch_data <- catch_original %>% 
  select(-All, -notesRegCode)

summary(catch_data)
```
```{r}
catch_data <- catch_original %>% 
  select(Region, Year, Chinook, Sockeye, Coho, Pink, Chum)

head(catch_data)
